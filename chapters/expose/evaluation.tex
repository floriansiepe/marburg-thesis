\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evalution}

Describe the planned evaluation process here. If you already have first experimental results from your scientific working pre-phase, you can present them here as well.

This section should explain the experiments that answer the research questions. How the the objectives be quantified/measured? What datasets, gold standards, metrics, experimental setups and (competitor) algorithms will be used for the evaluation? How can the proposed experiments verify whether or not certain goals have been reached?

Make sure that the datasets, gold standards and algorithm implementations are actually available!
