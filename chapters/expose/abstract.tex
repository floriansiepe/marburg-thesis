	\noindent\textbf{Abstract}
	This is a template document for writing an Exposé in the Big Data Analytics group at the Philipps-University of Marburg. It provides the general structure of an Exposé, instructions on what to write in each section, and some fundamental LaTeX constructs. Never use cites and footnotes in a proper abstract, but you can find more details on how to write a good abstract for your Exposé here\footnote{\url{http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/essays/abstract.html}}.
